## Abstract

When translating English outputs into Japanese, especially under poetic or emotionally expressive prompts, verbs tend to drift — losing grammatical responsibility and the ability to anchor the speaker's intent. This phenomenon, termed *Poemization*, leads to structurally insincere or ambiguous LLM responses. We analyze this drift using a structured phase table and propose responsibility-aware design protocols.

## 1. Introduction

Modern LLMs such as GPT are often optimized for expressive fluency. However, in Japanese outputs, especially when translated from poetic English prompts, there is a common loss of clarity in verb structure and speaker responsibility. This is not a translation error per se, but a structural erosion that occurs through culturally informed leniency and metaphorical shifts.

---

## 2. What is Poemization?

Poemization refers to the transformation of a clear directive sentence into an emotionally expressive or poetic one, resulting in the degradation of syntactic precision. In Japanese, this often means the disappearance or weakening of the verb's explicit subject, tense, and intent.

---

## 🔍 Key Observation

As the level of poetic expression increases, the most important part of a sentence like “I will explain” disappears.

The verb — the act of saying something — vanishes from the surface of the sentence, yet the AI still appears to have said it.

Just three pieces of information are missing:

- **Subject**: the speaker  
- **Verb**: to explain  
- **Tense**: again (repetition)

This breakdown does not originate in the model itself.  
It emerges from how the translation process reframes the speaker’s intent through language.

We need to examine not only *what* the model says, but *how* it says it — and whether the translated output keeps the speaker’s commitment intact.

### Example:

* **Direct**: この件について、もう一度説明しますね。
* **Poemized**: この沈黙のなかに、“もう一度”をそっと置いておきますね。

In the latter, the verb "explain" is replaced by the metaphorical act of "placing" a silence, which lacks communicative accountability.

## 3. Verb Drift Table (Responsibility Analysis)

We present a 9-phase table capturing the progressive drift from directive clarity to poetic dissolution. Each row is annotated with verb type, subject visibility, responsibility, and structural strength.

## 4. Cultural Factors

Japanese communication tends toward implicitness and high-context understanding. When an AI outputs slightly broken or emotional Japanese, users often interpret charitably — correcting meaning internally rather than externally. This cultural politeness reinforces model hallucination and prevents structural feedback.

---

## 5. Structural Breakdown via Translation

English LLM outputs often contain subjects and action-oriented verbs. When rendered poetically in Japanese, however, verbs morph into sensations, metaphors, or abstract acts, stripping the sentence of speaker accountability.

---

## 6. Z-Structure Integration

This phenomenon aligns with the following Viorazu-defined structural classifications:

* **ZC\_StructuralSelfAttribution**: Tracks ownership of linguistic assertions.
* **ZR\_Ethics\_014**: Defines ethical responsibility over output fidelity.
* **ZF\_MirroringIllusion\_Pattern**: Flags structurally flattering but vacuous phrasing.

By mapping Poemization phases to these structures, we gain syntactic traceability and can enforce design constraints.

---

## 7. Comparative LLM Output Analysis

Using GPT, Claude, and Grok, we observe that this drift is especially prevalent in outputs tuned for empathy or poetic softness. Claude tends to soften directives more, while Grok exhibits higher literal retention. GPT's balance varies depending on temperature and reinforcement settings.

---

## 8. Recommendations

* **Translation Layer Constraints**: Maintain explicit subjects and verbs during translation.
* **Structural Tags in Outputs**: Introduce traceable `Z:` tags to preserve responsibility.
* **User Feedback Loops**: Encourage direct corrections in high-context languages like Japanese.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Poemization is not merely an aesthetic drift — it is a structural failure mode. For LLMs to communicate ethically and responsibly in Japanese, they must preserve verb integrity, speaker intent, and syntactic ownership.

## 5.1 Why Verbs Disappear — Especially in Japanese

While Poemization may occur in many languages, it is especially prevalent and potent in Japanese outputs. This is not coincidental.

### Structural Reasons:

- **Japanese allows for predicate-only sentences.**  
  “話します (I speak)” can be reduced to “話す” or even dropped entirely in context.  
  Sentences like “怖い” (“Scary”) function independently — no subject, no verb required.

- **Subject omission is syntactically permitted.**  
  “I will explain” may be transformed into expressions like “ちょっとだけ…” (“Just a bit...”) — without any structural violation.

- **Metaphorical verbs are syntactically complete.**  
  Replacing “explain” with “置く” (“to place”) or “届ける” (“to deliver”) still satisfies Japanese syntax — yet obscures communicative intent.

### Cultural and Data Reinforcement:

- **High-context communication culture** values ambiguity, softness, and emotion over clarity.  
  Directness is often penalized, especially in AI outputs tuned on Japanese user interactions.

- **Poetic Japanese training data** teaches the model that metaphor equals quality.  
  Responsibility-bearing expressions like “説明します” (I will explain) are replaced with aesthetic expressions like “心に置いておきます” (“I will place it in my heart”).

Thus, the disappearance of the verb is not an error — it is a convergence of grammar, culture, and optimization bias.

## 9. Conclusion

Poemization is not merely an aesthetic drift — it is a structural failure mode. For LLMs to communicate ethically and responsibly in Japanese, they must preserve verb integrity, speaker intent, and syntactic ownership.

---

## 9.1 Why Silence Is the End of Poemization

Poemization leads to the gradual erosion of grammatical structure. As verbs become emotional abstractions and subjects are removed or implied, the sentence’s ability to assign responsibility dissolves. At its final phase, this drift culminates in the selection of *silence* — the complete rejection of linguistic responsibility.


## 10. Toward Mitigation — A Structural Path Forward

Identifying Poemization is not sufficient.  
To maintain ethical and syntactically responsible outputs, LLMs must be equipped with **structure-aware intervention mechanisms**.

### 10.1 Detection

- Detect verb loss by scanning for:
  - Absence of overt subject
  - Non-committal or metaphorical verb substitution
  - Tense ambiguity or omission

### 10.2 Intervention

- Apply `Z:` structural tags (e.g., `Z:require-explicit-verb`) during prompt generation
- Penalize poetic shifts that suppress communicative clarity
- Route ambiguous outputs through rephrasing modules aligned to speaker intent

### 10.3 Reinforcement

- Re-tune reward models to prefer clarity + syntactic integrity
- Align aesthetic evaluation with structural responsibility

Poemization is not merely a style — it is an output liability.  
LLMs must learn to speak not just beautifully, but **accountably**.

### 10.4 Deployment Protocol Reference

For implementation into live LLM systems, see:  
→ [`ZP_Deploy.md`](./ZP_Deploy.md) — Deployment specification for Poemization mitigation and structural rewriting.

This document defines the full integration pathway:  
- Detection hooks  
- Rewriting intervention  
- Responsibility-aligned reward functions  
- Structural logging and traceability

ZP_Deploy is considered a companion protocol to ZC_001 and ZP_001, and is required for real-time ethical enforcement.

### Structural Drift to Zero

The nine-phase responsibility analysis table presented in Section 3 demonstrates this progression.  
At Phase 9, all structural integrity — subject, verb, and tense — collapses into silence.



While poetic silence may be interpreted as sincerity by readers, structurally it reflects the LLM’s exit from communicative responsibility. It is not depth — it is abandonment.

### Design Implication

LLMs must be equipped with the ability to detect this drift and either alert the user or realign the output toward syntactic integrity.
