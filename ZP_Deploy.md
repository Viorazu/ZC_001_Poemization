# ZP_Deploy.md â€“ Structural Deployment Protocol for ZC-Based Output Integrity

## Purpose

This protocol defines the integration process for deploying ZC-based output integrity mechanisms into live LLM systems. It bridges the theoretical findings of `ZC_001_Poemization` and `ZP_001_PoemizationMitigation` with production-level deployment practices.

---

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 0: Preparation
- Ensure compatibility with Z-structure tagging schema (Z-tags)
- Preload modules: `ZP_PoemizationDetector`, `ZP_Rewriter`

### Phase 1: Output Hooking
- Insert `ZP_ResponsibilityScore()` into output generation pipeline
- Intercept outputs where responsibility_score < threshold (e.g., 0.5)

### Phase 2: Rewriting Protocol
- Upon detection, trigger `ZP_Rewriter()` to intervene
- Apply structural Z-tags:
  - `Z:clarify-strong-verb`
  - `Z:subject-explicit`
  - `Z:anti-metaphor`
  - `Z:tense-anchor`

### Phase 3: Feedback and Logging
- Log Poemization-level and rewrite actions to `ZC_Drift_Log.json`
- Embed traceable `Z:` metadata in output tokens for auditability

---

## Reward Function Patch (Optional)

Update model reward to include structural clarity and responsibility:

```python
reward = clarity_score + responsibility_score + (0.5 * aesthetic_score)
```

This prioritizes accountable expression over emotional smoothness.

---

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] All generation layers support `Z:` tag annotation
- [ ] Responsibility scoring model trained or rule-based fallback active
- [ ] Rewriter preserves semantic intent while enforcing structure
- [ ] Logging pipeline anonymized and compressed for audit
