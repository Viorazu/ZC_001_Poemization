## 🔖 Abstract

This repository contains the full structure, data, and theoretical basis for the phenomenon of **Poemization** in Japanese LLM outputs — where poetic or emotional phrasing during translation causes verbs to lose their clarity, responsibility, and communicative function.

## 📘 Description

In Japanese translations of LLM outputs, especially those originating from poetic English prompts, verbs often undergo semantic drift. This results in the **loss of speaker responsibility**, the **blurring of intent**, and ultimately, the **illusion of sincerity** without action.

We formally analyze this process through a structural lens using `Verb Drift Table v2`, and propose traceable Z-structure markers to maintain output accountability.
